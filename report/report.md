# Exploratory Data Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This EDA analyzed a dataset of 1,000 houses with 8 numeric columns. Key findings include:
- No missing data or outliers detected in any column.
- Distributions are approximately normal with slight negative skewness and platykurtic kurtosis.
- Strong positive correlation (0.991) between Square_Footage and House_Price, indicating it's a primary predictor.
- Weak correlations for other variables with House_Price (e.g., Lot_Size: 0.160, Year_Built: 0.052).
- Categorical-like variables (e.g., Num_Bedrooms, Garage_Size) show balanced frequency distributions.

## 2. Data Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: All 1,000 rows have no missing values across all columns.
- **Consistency**: Data types are appropriate (int64 for discrete, float64 for continuous).
- **Outliers**: No outliers found using z-score >3 method for any numeric column.
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient at approximately 0.06 MB.

## 3. Distribution Analysis Results
- **Square_Footage**: Mean 2,815.42, std 1,255.51, range 503 to 4,999. Slight negative skew (-0.066).
- **Num_Bedrooms**: Mean 2.99, nearly uniform distribution with counts: 2 (215), 5 (205), 1 (201), 4 (197), 3 (182).
- **Num_Bathrooms**: Mean 1.97, distribution: 1 (350), 2 (327), 3 (323).
- **Year_Built**: Mean 1986.55, std 20.63, range 1950 to 2022, indicating houses built over 72 years.
- **Lot_Size**: Mean 2.78, std 1.30, range 0.51 to 4.99.
- **Garage_Size**: Mean 1.02, distribution: 2 (343), 1 (336), 0 (321).
- **Neighborhood_Quality**: Mean 5.62, std 2.89, range 1 to 10, with top values: 10 (123), 5 (109), 2 (105).
- **House_Price**: Mean $618,861, std $253,568, range $111,627 to $1,108,237.
All distributions show no significant skew or kurtosis issues.

## 4. Relationship Insights
- **Strong Correlation**: Square_Footage and House_Price have a very high Pearson correlation of 0.991, suggesting it's a key feature for price prediction.
- **Weak Positive Correlations**: Lot_Size with House_Price (0.160), Num_Bedrooms with Garage_Size (0.114), and Square_Footage with Lot_Size (0.089).
- **Weak Negative Correlations**: Year_Built with Lot_Size (-0.061), Num_Bedrooms with Neighborhood_Quality (-0.049).
- Year_Built shows minimal correlation with other variables, including House_Price (0.052), indicating it may not be a strong predictor alone.

## 6. Next Questions for Further Analysis
- How does Square_Footage interact with other variables in a multiple regression model to predict House_Price?
- Are there non-linear relationships between Year_Built and House_Price that aren't captured by Pearson correlation?
- What is the impact of Neighborhood_Quality on House_Price when controlling for other factors like Square_Footage?
- Can clustering techniques identify distinct groups of houses based on features like Square_Footage, Lot_Size, and Year_Built?
- How do the distributions and relationships change if we consider time series aspects, e.g., trends in Year_Built over time?
